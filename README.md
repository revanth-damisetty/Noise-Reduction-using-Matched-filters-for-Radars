# Noise-Reduction-using-Matched-filters-for-Radars

# Objective:
  - use Matched filter to reduce the noise
  - comparing the transmitted signal to reduced signal to find its efficiency
 
# Software Used:
  - Python 3.7
  - Matplotlib Library
  - Numpy Library
  - Scipy Library
# Conclusion:
-Matched filter is used to reduced the noise based on correlation and the noise is removed to get a denoised signal.
